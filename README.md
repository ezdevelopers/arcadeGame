# Arcade Game Project - Frogger Game
## How do I complete this project?
Checkout the online game  [Frogger me](https://ezdevelopers.github.io/arcadeGame/).

1. In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

## Game Instructions
2. Player can not move off screen.
3. Vehicles cross the screen.
4. Vehicle-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too later).
5. Vehicle-player collision resets the game.
6. Something happens when player wins.
7. Game objects (player and vehicles) are implemented using JavaScript object-oriented programming features.
8. Add extra features, use creativity e.g accept mobile input

The repository contains css, images, and js folders, as well as an index.html and a README.md file. Once you have downloaded the files which udacity have provided, you will have to edit app.js to build the game.

* **css/**: The css folder contains a style.css file which you do not need to edit
* **images/**: The images folder contains the png image files, which are used when displaying the game. The images for the player and enemy character are going to be loaded from this folder.
* **js/**: The js folder also contains the app engine needed to run the game and a resources.js file. You do not need to edit these files.
* **index.html**: opening index.html should load the game
* **css/style.css**: Contains all of the CSS needed to style the page.
* **README.md**: should contain instructions on how to load and play the game (you will need to add those instructions).
